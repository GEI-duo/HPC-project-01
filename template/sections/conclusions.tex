\section{Conclusions}

From the graphs of the previous \textit{Section \ref{sec:results}}, we can extract some conclusions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Since we added some overhead, as we predicted, our executions of the code with OMP with 1 thread are worse than the serial code.
    \item Since the machines the code ran on have 4 cores, the execution of the code with OMP with 8 threads is worse than the execution with 4 threads.
    \item The execution time starts to improve when using >2 threads (obviously), and it's further improved when the problem size is bigger, with bigger matrix sizes and more steps.
    \item The efficiency is not that good in any execution, but they are quite similar (excluding the 100 steps execution), so we can `ignore' it and, in the future, decide to just use the best speedup, which is the 4 threads.
\end{itemize}
